            <h1>Who are the best male and female American Swimmers at the moment?</h1>
        </center>
        <p>
            There is a lot of contention and competition between swimmers; however, the most prominent for each gender are Caeleb Dressle and Katie Ledecky. This is because they are both multiple time gold medalists at the Olympics and have dominated multiple events for a prolific amount of time. It is quite obvious that they are the most dominiant American Swimmer. Below, I will give more information why this is true.

        <img src="images/caelebD.jpeg" alt = "Caeleb Dressle">
        <h2>Why is he the #1 male swimmer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Won all 7 of his Olympic Events</li>
            <li>Has 21 World Championship wins</li>
            <li>Currently holds 8 World Records</li>
        </ol>

        <h2><a href=https://www.instagram.com/katieledecky/?hl=en>Katie Ledecky</a></h2>
        <img src="images/katieL2.webp" alt = "Katie Ledecky">
        <h2>Why is she the #1 female swimmer</h2>
        <p>She currently holds the 17 fastest times in World History in the 1500 M freestyle. Here are the top 3</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>1.</td>
                <td>8:04.79</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2.</td>
                <td>8:06.68</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3.</td>
                <td>8:07.27</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>From this above data it is quite obvious they are the #1 swimmers for their gender. Katie Ledecky dominates the 1500m free and many other distance events. Dressle is a master of sprinting and has won every single olympic event he has swam. You can do with this info what you want, but I think the answer is obvious to who is the best American swimmers.</p>
